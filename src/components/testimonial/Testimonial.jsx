      "I had the privilege of working with Shivang Mishra over the last couple of months and he has proven that he is a skilled iOS developer. Shivang is a smart and charismatic personality that is enjoyable to work with and a great guy to have around. The quality that stood out to me the most about Shivang during our time working together is his dedicated work ethic. When the going gets tough, he does not hesitate to roll up his sleeves and work hard as well as efficiently. His work is thorough and well thought out, and he learns to adapt quickly under pressure and stressed deadlines. Shivangâ€™s strong technical skills and welcoming personality makes him a great asset for any team that is looking to build a crisp and comprehensive product.",
